This is my first try to apply machine learning to my data.
I have data of groups of ants collectively carrying objects through a maze.

1. data_frame_machineLearning.json contains information on experiments.

2. contacts_machineLearning.json contains information on instances, in which the load hit the wall in the experiment.
